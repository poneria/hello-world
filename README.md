# Hello World
This is my Hello World repository that I started to learn how to use git and GitHub. I continue to use it in order to practice as well as a place to record my personal notes and observations about open source projects I'm looking at.

I'm a CS student currently. I'm currently taking Java as a class, but I'm learning Javascript on my own in addition to refreshing my knowledge of HTML/CSS. I'm also interested in learning Android Studio so I can create my own apps for my monk's D&D 5e campaign.

I used to write guides/articles on Warlocks in World of Warcraft.

## Observations structure
Sort by project folders, then by date in filename. Plain text files.

Don't mind me writing down git commands; I'm a super newb.
