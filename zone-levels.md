# Zone levels in WoW 7.3.5 PTR change

### Sources section
- sources
- methodologies/arbitration

### Considerations
- min caps & max caps
- how stuff scales w/ the player in a capped zone
-- levels
-- gear
-- abilities
- map flow + dungeon locations

### MMORPGs to use
- WoW -- play
- GW2 -- play
- FF14 -- *research* + can play
- ESO -- *research*
- SW: TOR -- *research*
to demonstrate zone levels as difficulty levels? & also game system interaction with difficulty levels in non MMORPGS:
- Destiny 2 -- *research*
- Diablo 3 -- play

### WoW specifically
- levels in zones -- fix errors
- dungeon spread also, since it probably influences player ability power since WoW was designed initially with quests going into dungeons (rather than current being found in dungeons)
- PvP zones??? + see if PvP talents start at a certain level
- map flow? A/H considerations
- ability spread -- across all classes O_O but also by general ability category
