To test things:
cd to WoWAnalyzer folder
npm start

Default spec folder setup:
using https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/pPYLA9kCf4tgNvh3#fight=25&type=damage-done as a log example (found via clicking though WCL)

I left maintainer & spec status alone, so it shows Zerotorescue/Holy Paladin stuff.

Statistic blocks:
Downtime 	| NLC		| Concordance
						| Distance moved + time spent moving

'Downtime' & 'NLC' take up more vertical space, so due to what I guess is a float style, 'distance moved' is actually right below 'Concordance' in the 3rd column, rather than in a "4th" spot below 'Downtime.' So adjusting statistic block order might require rethinking box heights so things line up.

Heights: NLC >= Downtime > Distance moved > Concordance

Items tracker is there

shows the Tarnished Sentinel Medallion

Tab modules are:

Suggestions | Talents | Cooldowns | Cast efficiency | Mana | Development | Events | Status

Suggestions = the rotation/improvement suggestions
- again, it has a ton of Holy Paladin suggestions
- again, not sure if the code for this is elsewhere

Talents = shows the talents the player had during the fight
- just shows the talents
- wonder if can incorporate damage done calculations here instead of using a statistic block
- alternatively, wonder if can delete this tab & make a talent statistic block, a la the item tracker, with just icons maybe

Cooldowns = presumably cooldowns go here, but the tab is empty/nothing

Cast efficiency = cast efficiency bars
- though it has Holy Paladin spells? despite having deleted those modules per the instructions
- must be designated elsewhere -- perhaps Core

Mana = two graphs: mana pool & mana usage

Development = Development Tools
- generates Javascript for abilities, buffs, items, etc.

Events straight up hangs/breaks

Status looks like WCL API stuff
