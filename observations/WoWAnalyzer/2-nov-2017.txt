Looked at CastEfficiency.js across all class-specs and made doumentation for it 
in CONTRIBUTING.SPEC.md. 

Attempted to pull request into my own fork, but messed something up between my 
local copy and the repository. My master branch is now up to date with 
WoWAnalyzer's master date, but my documentation branch is ahead in the 
CONTRIBUTING.SPEC.md file and behind in everything else. Going to practice that 
merging on my hello-word repository.

Unfortunately I can't test this until I get home because I haven't figured out
how to get git command line on a USB drive so I can use it on public computers.

But setup:

- [ ] hello-world/master up to date with commit#61c6844
- [ ] add new-branch
- [ ] push different 2-nov-2017.txt to new-branch
- [ ] on hello-master, update README.md
- [ ] practice merging updated master on new-branch
- [ ] practice pull request from new-branch to master
