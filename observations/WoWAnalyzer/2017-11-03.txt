Practicing pull request/merge on my hello-world repository. While at NRCC, I'm
working with the online GitHub interface; when I get home, I can repeat this on 
my home machine in command line with 3-nov-2017.txt.

//------------------------
// WEB INTERFACE
//------------------------

- Able to merge/These branches can be automatically merged. -- probably
because I'm the only contributor to my repository. GitHub FAQ on PRs/merging
was that the automatic merging doesn't work when 2+ people have edited the 
same file, so there are different versions, not a simple +/- by the same person.

new-branch:
- 1 commit behind & 1 commit ahead of master.

if PR [base: master] ... [compare: new-branch]
then
shows changed 2-nov-2017.text with the changes by new-branch

if PR [base: new-branch] ... [compare: master]
then 
shows changed file README.md with the changes by master

>> All checks have passed
>> This branch has no conflicts with the base branch.
>> #9a74a02 Merges README.md
>> #15c408e Merges PR#3

master:
- README.md is the updated README.md
- 2-nov-2017.txt is the original master file (1st part).

new-branch:
- 2 commits ahead of master.
- README.md is the updated README.md
- 2-nov-2017.txt is the new-branch file (2nd part).

if PR [base: master] ... [compare: new-branch]
then
shows changed 2-nov-2017.text with the changes by new-branch

It would just merge with the updated 2-nov-2017.txt (2nd part only), but I 
want both parts. I go back and add the 1st part to my local 2nd part & push 
that to new-branch.

new-branch:
- 3 commits ahead of master.
- README.md is the updated README.md
- 2-nov-2017.txt is the manually combined master/new-branch file (1st & 2nd 
parts).

if PR [base: master] ... [compare: new-branch]
then
shows changed 2-nov-2017.text with the manually merged changes by new-branch

>> This branch has no conflicts with the base branch.
>> Merging can be performed automatically.
>> # Merges PR#4 
>> PR successfully merged and closed. the new-branch branch can be safely deleted.

new-branch:
- 1 commit behind master.
- README.md is the updated README.md
- 2-nov-2017.txt is the manually combined master/new-branch file (1st & 2nd 
parts).

master:
- (up to date)
- README.md is the updated README.md
- 2-nov-2017.txt is the manually combined master/new-branch file (1st & 2nd 
parts).

>> Delete branch
- goto branches on web interface
- lists branches overview, there's a purple Merge button on the new-branch 
listing that will bring you to PR page on repository
- Alternatively: just go to PR page on repository, toggle closed PRs, select PR.
- Delete branch.
- "poneria deleted the new-branch branch just now" with optional "Restore 
branch" button

1 branch: master

//------------------------
// SETUP ON WEB FOR NEXT
//------------------------

Push/upload 3-nov-2017.txt to master branch so there's a 3-nov-2017 observation to later merge with.

//------------------------
// COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
//------------------------

I didn't actually get the command line practice done on the 3rd due to watching some 
BlizzCon hype, but I need a duplicate file, so here it is.

Thinking about resetting the forked project & trying again after this.

I totally saved this in the wong spot, though.
