second-branch: 
- 4 commits ahead, 2 commits behind master
- README.md: old
- 3-nov-2017.txt: 2nd

master: 
- Up to date.
- README.md: new
- 3-nov-2017.txt: 1st

This actually works out well as an example, because my local is fucked up again, 
so I need to figure out how to resolve that, probably by a lot of manual updates. 

Note though: my local changes when I switch branches from the way out-of-date 
second-branch to the up-to-date master branch.

on master:
git merge second-branch
replaced 3 nov 2017 with the second-branch one, & the README.md stayed updated. Automerge?

OK I got it resolved. Basically --> do the PR on the website. Still don't feel like I 
got it, though. More practice, maybe on the actual fork so it won't automerge.
