### enchantCheck: Working on missing/cheap enchants
---
**pseudocode**
```
look at slots{
    if enchant {
        if best enchant
        if better/cheap enchant
        if "wrong spec"/this expac enchant (wearing wrong set gear - for dual specs)

        suggestion
        .minor
    }
    else no enchant {
        suggestion
        .major
        .optional/last importance
    }
}
```

Then also was looking at [legendary upgrades checker](https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/blob/master/src/Parser/Core/Modules/Items/LegendaryUpgradeChecker.js) again. Maybe try line 21 `.filter(item => item.permanentEnchant !== undefined)` to weed out non-enchanted slots. Ideally, someone using only Legion enchants would just have enchants on those slots. However, might have to addtionally filter the weapon slots to un-catch spec-specific weapon enchants like Runeforging (or could include Runeforging for DKs).

For solutions to seeing if the enchant is accepted/cheap, looking at questions for finding an element in a list/array. [Apparently](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7378228/check-if-an-element-is-present-in-an-array) there's an `includes` method for that in [ES](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes). Sample code: 
```javascript
[1, 2, 3].includes(2);     // true
[1, 2, 3].includes(4);     // false
[1, 2, 3].includes(3, 3);  // false
```
So can list best enchants in an array, then cheap enchants in another array, check item's enchant against each of those in turn, break out if found. If no listed enchant found, but still enchant found, then suggestion for "hey you have the wrong enchant, do you have the right gear?" & then separate for no enchant at all found.

**pseudocode**
```
look at slots{
    Object.values(slots).filter(only items with an enchant or specific slots)
        if enchant {
            if best enchant
            if better/cheap enchant
            if "wrong spec"/this expac enchant (wearing wrong set gear - for dual specs)

            suggestion
            .minor
        }
}
```
However, problem with filtering out slots that don't have enchants -- it assumes perfect situation where enchants are not forgotten. Need to still check all potential enchant slots for an enchant.

From [Combatant](https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/blob/master/src/Parser/Core/Combatant.js):
```javascript
export const GEAR_SLOTS = {
  NECK: 1,

  FINGER1: 10,
  FINGER2: 11,

  BACK: 14,
  MAINHAND: 15,
  OFFHAND: 16,
};
```

IDK can I do a specific slots array [1, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16] & then forEach that + use the slots array values to do the other loop? Since I know WoW's enchant slots might change per expac. [Filtering invalid entries from JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).

**Documentation** for the module can include the list of enchant ids for each slot/effect, so they can be picked & put in the file per spec.

**Unit test** -- idk exactly how to do that, but can put in the console stuff, I guess. Or figure out what unit testing is for ES/JS. Maybe [start](https://medium.com/powtoon-engineering/a-complete-guide-to-testing-javascript-in-2017-a217b4cd5a2a), [also](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-every-unit-test-needs-f6cd34d9836d).
