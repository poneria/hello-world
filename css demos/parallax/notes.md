# Notes
These are my notes as I teach myself about parallax scrolling in CSS for scrollytelling.

# Sources

## Dev tools
- [Placeholder images](http://placekitten.com/) = `http://placekitten.com/width/height` in pixels

## with mainly CSS
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp)

  - [Full code/examples](https://codepen.io/collection/XBWPqE/#) linked in article
    - [Sticky progress]9https://codepen.io/snookca/pen/ZvpZYE) by Jonathan Snook -- elements sticking together would be nice for my idea of (Trumbull) lyric lines as scrolling sticking together in partial/whole verses
    - [Horizontal slide in and out effect using sticky elements](https://codepen.io/rpsthecoder/pen/LJZzRV) by Preethi Sam -- cool idea
    - [Scrollytelling with position sticky](https://codepen.io/enatario/pen/eKzxzY) by Elaina Natario -- side scrolling text + full-width text at the bottom
    - [Scrollytelling with position sticky - full images](https://codepen.io/enatario/pen/jKrJpB) by Elaina Natario -- full background image + not-full-width scrolling text + full-width text at the bottom
      - [ ] study this for Trumbull lyrics scroll --> HTML + CSS only

## with mainly Javascript libraries
