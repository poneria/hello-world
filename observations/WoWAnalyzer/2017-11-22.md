### Working on missing/cheap enchants
---
**[Issue #685](https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/issues/685)** labeled as a "good first time" issue. We'll see about that. Looking at missing/cheap enchant suggestion.

First attempt was mostly clobbering Javascript together. I started with duplicating [Ilterendi](https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/blob/master/src/Parser/Paladin/Holy/Modules/Items/Ilterendi.js) in the Holy Paladin items, then moved on to discovering what I could grab from what items the selected player had. I eventually landed upon the general [Combatant file](https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/blob/master/src/Parser/Core/Combatant.js) & the legendary item checkers [upgrades](https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/blob/master/src/Parser/Core/Modules/Items/LegendaryUpgradeChecker.js) & [count](https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/blob/master/src/Parser/Core/Modules/Items/LegendaryCountChecker.js). Also I looked a bit at [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch2.md). I used the legendary upgrade to cycle through items so I could match enchants on items. 

`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` to open Chrome console, btw.

I have a rudimentary working file up, but it probably doesn't test well. It cycles through ALL the slots, so it doesn't differentiate between not having an enchant on a helm (fine) & not having an enchant on a cloak (missing and enchant). I need to figure out how to grab which slot I'm looking at. 

Also, I want to see if I can make it general + 1 specific in class-spec, rather than a stupid big file or not. Maybe look at Abilities between specs & Core. 
* General: checking the appropriate slots for what's there. 
* Specific: Comparing what's there in a slot to what's appropriate or preferred for a spec in that slot.
